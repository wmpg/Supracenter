Trajectory Interpolator
=======================

The Trajectory Interpolator will produce a .csv of 4-Dimensional points of the trajectory defined in the current event .bam file. Note that currently the points produced are only an approximation. The .csv produced by this tool may be directly imported into the event .bam file to quickly plot a bunch of test fragmentations along the trajectory. It is intended to use this along with the Fragmentation Staff to identify the heights of possible fragmentation arrivals for a given station.
