Supracenter PSO Search
**********************

Chose a 4-D bounding box to search in, giving the 3-D spatial barrier and a 1-D temporal barrier. Give the station picks file, created by the Make Picks window. The program will search for the optimal Supracenter within the 3-D bounding box, and try to optimize the for the best solution with the lowest residuals. The residuals are calculated by the difference between the expected arrival time of a trial point, and the arrival time given in the picks file.
