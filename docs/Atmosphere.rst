Setting Up Atmospheric Fetching
===============================

Setting up atmospheric fetching is a one-time setup which will allow data to be downloaded from the Copernicus Climate Change Store automatically.

Follow the instructions given here, with the given exceptions below:
https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api-how-to

Step 1: Needs to be done locally, since the url and key depend on the users login

Step 2: Proceed as normal

Step 3: Does not need to be done, the Fetch Atmosphere tab does this for you, and will request the data, and display it automatically.
