PKL Files
---------

pkl files contain the information for a given fireball event. These are loaded into each part of the program with the parameters of the fireball. For most parts of the program, not all of the variables in the pkl files need to be set. For example, in the Supracenter solver, the ballistic search parameters do not need to be filled out.

If the terminal returns an "INI ERROR" while running the code, try setting [General] debug = True, which will print out what variables are being detected by the program. 

As of June 2019, the INI file format has been replaced by the PKL format to reduce outputting to a human readable form. The PKL files can be completely edited with the GUI
