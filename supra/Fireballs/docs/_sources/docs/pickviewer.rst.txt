Pick Viewer
***********

Pick viewer allows the user to edit station pick files created by Make Picks. Station pick files are CSV files with information about the station that was picked, and the time of the pick. The pick viewer allows the user to load in a station pick file, and edit the values inside. The CSV file may then be saved to a file for further use with other parts of the program.

Recommended use of the Pick Viewer is to delete picks manually after running Supracenter or Ballistic solutions, if it is found that one pick does not belong. It is also useful for fine tuning the times of arrivals at stations if it is easier than clicking the time of arrival. Finally, the Pick Viewer may also be used to create fake arrival time data, if theoretically created fireballs are being used, as a control.
