Extra Stations
##############

To add a station manually, the station name, location and mseed file must be input into the .pkl file through the GUI. Most seismic waveform databases online will allow for an mseed file to be downloaded. The file must be put in with the rest of the mseed files, which is located in: output_folder/fireball_name

Most data sources also allow for .kml files to be downloaded. It may be useful to compile all seismic stations into a single kml file for use with Google Earth Pro, and using the circle measure tool to find stations within 150 km of an event.

Sites that stations can be downloaded from:

* North Carolina - http://service.ncedc.org/fdsnws/dataselect/1/
* South Carolina - https://service.scedc.caltech.edu/fdsnws/dataselect/1/
* Turkey - http://tdvm.afad.gov.tr/
* Europe - http://udim.koeri.boun.edu.tr/mseed/
* Europe - http://eida.gfz-potsdam.de/webdc3/
* IRIS - http://service.iris.edu/fdsnws/dataselect/docs/1/builder/

Others may be found by searching for .mseed files online

Editing the values for the station as shown in the above figure will change parameters of that Station object. They are as follows:

* Station Network - The two letter code referring to the network name
* Station Code - The (typically) three to five letter code representing a specific station in a network.
* Latitude - The latitude of the station [-90, 90]
* Longitude - The longitude of the station [-180, 180]
* Elevation - The elevation of the station above sea-level [meters]
* Station Display Name - How the station is to be displayed in the terminal
* Channel - The channel of the specific .mseed file (for organizational purposes only, one channel per .mseed)
* File Name - The name of the .mseed file, placed in the working directory

In the current build, limit one channel, one waveform, to one .mseed file.
