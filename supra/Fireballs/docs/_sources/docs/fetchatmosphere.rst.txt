   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Fetch Atmosphere
----------------

This window allows the user to choose a time and the weather data will be downloaded for that time. The variables used are Temperature, U-Component of Wind (wind from West to East), and V-Component of Wind (wind from South to North). Once opened, a weather profile can be made at a specific latitude and longitude for analysis.

You can either download a file under the name specified by clicking "download", or you can open an existing weather profile under the name specified on your computer by clicking "open".
