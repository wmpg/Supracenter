	Reworked arrival time calculation for MakeIRISPicks.py. Times are now calculated before the window opens. 

	The framework for perturbations is now in MakeIRISPicks.py. Currently, BMT and SPPT methods are supported, but methods can be changed around if needed later. A method to use the Ensemble Spread from ECMWF is in the works. Perturbation arrival times show up as faint lines on the waveform.

	The arrival times are exported as a .npy file, so that the same perturbations that were used in MakeIRISPicks.py can be used with Supracenter.py and SeismicTrajectory.py once they are implemented.

	Minor bug fixes, cleaned terminal output.

Dec. 7, 2018

	Supracenter grid_search mode is not supported for now, use pso search only

	Added station number to data_picks.csv

	Supracenter works with the perturbations generated by MakeIRISPicks.py. A .npy file is exported from MakeIRISPicks.py, that should be referenced in a Supracenter.ini

	Added a trajectory constraint to Supracenter, put in one point and angle directions or 2 points, and Supracenter will only return points within range of the trajectory. If using this, errors will begin high, but converge down to normal values. Use a large swarm size and iterations

	MakeIRISPicks, define a trajectory using a point and the direction of the angles, add lat_i, lon_i, and elev_i to [Ballistic]. Doing this will overwrite the lat_centre and lon_centre values with the new calculated value. To not use this, do not write lat_i in the .ini

	GetIRISData.ini [Ballistic] t variable should now be positive (was negative)

	GetIRISData and MakeIRISPicks now will sort stations based off of channel. Any manually added stations need to have a channel specified on them:
	["KO", "BNGB", 38.9913, 40.6792, 0, "KO.BNGB", BNGB.mseed"] now becomes -> ["KO", "BNGB", 38.9913, 40.6792, 0, "KO.BNGB", "BHZ", BNGB.mseed"]

	SeismicTrajectory Fixes - Program will not break if error histogram doesn't show

Jan. 4, 2019
	
	Added weather viewer for data. No connection to main program yet

Jan. 6, 2019

	Temporal perturbations

Jan. 14, 2019

	All new runs will require for pulled station data to be re-downloaded. Any manually added stations only need a "channel tag" in the ini (see Dec. 29 update)

Mar. 6, 2019
	
	Redefined coordinate system as standard cartesian coordinate system, with azimuth from the north, increasing east. 
	Created position objects
	Created station objects

	Separated files from wmpl.
