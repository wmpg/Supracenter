#             Usage             #
#################################
    To run the progam, create a .ini as shown below. Navagate the terminal to the folder containing wmpl:

    Terminal:
    GetIRISData.py
    python -m supra.Fireballs.GetIRISData <location of .ini file>

    MakeIRISPicks.py
    python -m supra.Fireballs.MakeIRISPicks <location of .ini file>

    SeismicTrajectory.py
    python -m supra.Fireballs.SeismicTrajectory <location of .ini file>

    Supracenter.py
    python -m supra.Supracenter.mainmenu <location of .ini file>

    iniBuilder
    python -m supra.Fireballs.SolutionGUI

    Optional Inputs:
        -h - help menu

    The .ini file should be as shown below. If the file is missing any variables, the program will return an error indicating which group of variables is missing. Example .ini files can be found in the /docs folder. GetIRISData.py and MakeIRISPicks.py use the same variables, but SeismicTrajectory only has a few variables in common. Therefore, it is recommended to use either two .ini files, one for GetIRISData.py and MakeIRISPicks.py, and the other for SeismicTrajectory.py, or, to use one large .ini file with all the variables included.

    Using weather data slows the program down. Therefore, it is recommended to do an initial search without weather, find the approximate solution, then repeat the simulation with a smaller search area, including weather, and fewer iterations.

#################################
#         Example Usage         #
#################################

    First create a .ini file describing the meteor that will be studied. This can be done manually, or through the inibuilder found in SolutionGUI.py

    Run GetIRISData.py to see if there is any possible seismic signals in the location and time. If there are not enough stations, other stations not listed on IRIS or ORFEUS may be obtainable through their respective websites, and added through [Extra Stations]. If video or external evidence of fragmentations or the trajectory exists, they can be plotted on the graphs through [Ballistic] and [Fragmentation]. This plot can also be used as a manual search for the variables in [Ballistic] and 
    [Fragmentation] by plotting the expected arrival times over the raw, station data.

    For further analysis in the waveforms, MakeIRISPicks.py can be run off of the same .ini file used in GetIRISData.py. This will bring up the waveforms one at a time, and picks from the fireball event can be made. This GUI is intended to help identify which signals are likely arrivals and which ones are noise. Exporting the data_picks.csv file allows these to be used in SeismicTrajectory.py for ballistic arrivals, and Supracneter.py for fragmentation. It is recommended to make separate .csv files for the ballistic and each fragmentation arrival.

    From here, .csv files from fragmentation events can be used with a Supracenter.ini file (see /Supracenter/docs/User Manual Supracenter.txt for more information), and .csv files from the ballistic arrival can be used with SeismicTrajectory.py

    It is recommended to run SeismicTrajectory.py with a large search area and without weather initially. Once the variables are better known, then a smaller search with weather can be made to refine the variables. This is because simulations with weather take much longer than without.

    (another example is given in the sample .ini files)  

#################################
#         Extra Stations        #
#################################

    To add a station manually, the station name, location and mseed file must be input into the .ini file. Most seismic waveform databases online will allow for an mseed file to be downloaded. The file must be put in with the rest of the mseed files, which is located in: output_folder/fireball_name

    Most data sources also allow for .kml files to be downloaded. It may be useful to compile all seismic stations into a single kml file for use with Google Earth Pro, and using the circle measure tool to find stations within 150 km of an event.

    Sites that stations can be downloaded from:

    North Carolina - http://service.ncedc.org/fdsnws/dataselect/1/
    South Carolina - https://service.scedc.caltech.edu/fdsnws/dataselect/1/
    Turkey - http://tdvm.afad.gov.tr/
    Europe - http://udim.koeri.boun.edu.tr/mseed/
    Europe - http://eida.gfz-potsdam.de/webdc3/
    IRIS - http://service.iris.edu/fdsnws/dataselect/docs/1/builder/

    Others may be found by searching for .mseed files online

    Green - Supracenter
    Blue  - Ballistic
    Red   - Constant Speed of Sound

    The distances marked on these graphs are the distances from the source center. This is to line up the expected times of arrival with the station waveforms. The actual arrival times and distances between each manual wave search and the stations are stated in an output file, in the same directory as the graphs. These are predicted times of arrival based off of the set speed of sound and given weather profiles.

# Atmospheric Data Instructions #
#################################

    Note: Weather data has been tested with recent files, older files may have a different format, in which a custom script to read them is required. See netCDFconv.py for more details. 

    Reading the wrong file may cause the program to freeze, such as trying to read UKMO .nc file as an ECMWF .nc file. Killing the program while it is reading the data may corrupt the file (while the message 'Converting weather data. This may take a while...' is in the terminal).

    Constants used in converting weather values can be found in wmpl/Utils/constants.ini

    ===================================
    UKMO Instructions - Manual Download
    ===================================
    Downloadable files can be found here:
    http://data.ceda.ac.uk/badc/ukmo-assim/

    An account will need to be created in order to access files

    UKMO data is found as a .pp file on the CEDA site

    Supracenter only handles .nc files, so the file needs to be converted.

    ---CONVERT .PP TO .NC-------------------------------------------------
    Download xConv1.94 <replace 1.94 with the current version number>
    http://cms.ncas.ac.uk/documents/xconv/
    and extract xconv1.94 and convsh1.94. Create a symbolic link to convsh: 

    Terminal:
    ln -s xconv1.94 convsh1.94

    In the folder with xconv and convsh, add conv2nc.tcl and runXconv.bat from the xconv_scripts file. Other
    example scripts can be found here: http://cms.ncas.ac.uk/documents/xconv/

    After this setup, .pp files in the folder can be converted to .nc files with the command:
    (Navigate to the folder)

    Terminal:
    ./convsh1.94 ./conv2nc.tcl -i <input file.pp> -o <output file.nc>
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Indicate in the .ini where the .nc file is, and the UKMO data can now be read by Supracenter

    Note: killing the program while reading a .nc file WILL corrupt the file

    Note: Data conversion may not work for older files, and may need to be read with a script

    Create an account with ECMWF

    Follow the instructions given:
    https://software.ecmwf.int/wiki/display/CKB/How+to+download+data+via+the+ECMWF+WebAPI

    Follow the instructions given up to before making the script, the script is in mainmenu.py:
    https://software.ecmwf.int/wiki/display/CKB/How+to+download+ERA5+data+via+the+ECMWF+Web+API

    Change the ECMWF script in mainmenu.py as needed, indicate the hour of the weather profile needed
    atm_hour is the hour that will be downloaded, if it is available.
    grid_size specifies the spatial resolution of the weather data from ECMWF 

    Note: Automatic data retrival may not work for older files

    MERRA-2 Instructions - Script Download
    ======================================
    Create an account: 
    https://wiki.earthdata.nasa.gov/display/EL/How+To+Register+With+Earthdata+Login

    Link the database with your account:
    https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/earthdata-login

    Enter your username and password into fetchMERRA.py

    Specify in the .ini where the file is and the name of the file, indicate the hour of the weather profile needed.
    atm_hour is the hour that will be downloaded, if it is available.

    Note: Automatic data retrival may not work for older files

    MERRA-2 Instructions - Manual Download
    ======================================
    Create an account:
    https://wiki.earthdata.nasa.gov/display/EL/How+To+Register+With+Earthdata+Login

    Link the database with your accout:
    https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/earthdata-login

    Download the data from the site:
    https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets/M2I3NVASM_V5.12.4/summary?keywords=%22MERRA-2%22

    Go to "subset/get data" and specify what area data is needed. Make sure the file type is NetCDF 4
    and the variables contain at least "air_temperature", "northward_wind", "eastward_wind", and "mid_layer_heights"

    Specify in the .ini where the file is and the name of the file

    Note: Data conversion may not work for older files, and may need to be read with a script

    ==================================
    Custom Atmospheric Data
    ==================================
    Create a custom .txt file containing the data, separated by spaces.
    An example can be found in /Supracenter/docs/Sample_Custom_Sounding_Data.txt

    There must be at least two rows for the program to be able to run.

    The format of the .txt file should be:
    --------------------------------------
    *header
    elevation(m) temperature(deg C) wind_speed(m/s) wind_direction(deg from north due east)
    --------------------------------------
   
    Specify in the .ini where the file is.

    ==================================
    Isotropic Atmospheric Data
    ==================================
    No file is required for an isotropic profile.

    The v_sound variable must be set, and the program will make a custom atmospheric dataset using the given speed of sound.
