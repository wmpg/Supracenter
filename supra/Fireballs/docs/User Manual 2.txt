Usage
=====================

To open the program, navigate to your Supracenter folder and type the following command:

    python -m supra.Fireballs.SolutionGUI

---------------------
INI Builder
---------------------

The INI builder is the tool used to specify the parameters of a fileball. Each fireball to be analyzed should have a separate file describing their parameters. The INI Builder allows for fireballs to be loaded and saved from the computer. When any event is run anywhere in this program, it will use data from the text edit boxes in the INI Builder, but will be overwritten by any text edit box in the tab that is being run. The text edit boxes in other tabs are linked to the INI Builder tabs, but the INI Builder text edits cannot be changed by other tabs unless "Copy To INI Builder" is clicked. 

Recommended use of the INI Builder is to create a fireball, and save it to an ini file so that it may be used later. This ini can be run in any tabs, and can be tweaked in the text edit boxes in each tab. Once the user is finished tweaking the variables, "Copy To INI Builder" may be clicked to overwrite the INI Builder. Then the INI Builder must be saved to an ini file to update the ini file.

---------------------
Pick Viewer
---------------------

Pick viewer allows the user to edit station pick files created by Make Picks. Station pick files are CSV files with information about the station that was picked, and the time of the pick. The pick viewer allows the user to load in a station pick file, and edit the values inside. The CSV file may then be saved to a file for further use with other parts of the program.

Recommended use of the Pick Viewer is to delete picks manually after running Supracenter or Ballistic solutions, if it is found that one pick does not belong. It is also useful for fine tuning the times of arrivals at stations if it is easier than clicking the time of arrival. Finally, the Pick Viewer may also be used to create fake arrival time data, if theoretically created fireballs are being used, as a control.

Files
====================

--------------------
INI Files
--------------------

ini files contain the information for a given fireball event. These are loaded into each part of the program with the parameters of the fireball. For most parts of the program, not all of the variables in the ini files need to be set. For example, in the Supracenter solver, the ballistic search parameters do not need to be filled out.

If the terminal returns an "INI ERROR" while running the code, try setting [General] debug = True, which will print out what variables are being detected by the program.
