        I found this from here, I had something similar, but this code works much better:
        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14783947/grouping-clustering-numbers-in-python
        it has been modified to work with pick objects

        Usage:

        Arguments:
        data [list] - list of Pick Objects to cluster together
        maxgap [float] - maximum cluster size (from first element to last element)

        Returns:
        groups [list] - a list of clusters, each of which is its own list of Pick Objects
