   contain the root `toctree` directive.


Atmosphere Files
----------------
 
Atmosphere files are saved as either NetCDF (.nc) or HDF (.hdf) files. When downloaded for use in this program, they should contain the temperature, and the u- and v- components of the wind, for each level, latitude, longitude, and temporal grid space. The spatial and temporal parts may be cut down to the area needed for a specific fireball in order to save space, (which can be done when downloading the data from online). This program will further cut down each atmosphere file to make a 2-D slice of atmosphere that the acoustic wave travels through.
