Supracenter Manual Search
-------------------------
Chose the 4-D fragmentation point, and input the station data and picks, created by the Make Picks window, and hit search. The program will return the error in that point, as well as the residuals to each station, based off of the difference in arrival times from the manual Supracenter to the expected pick arrival time.
