*************************
Atmosphere Profile Viewer
*************************

An one-dimensional atmosphere profile slice can be viewed at a specific latitude and longitude for temperature and winds. Perturbations may also be generated for this data. 

This section acts as a GUI interface for the ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) ERA-5 (Fifth generation of ECMWF atmospheric reanalyses of the global climate) data found here: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels?tab=overview, which may be used to download an area of atmospheric data, observe, and export slices. 

Once the Copernicus API key is installed, the user no longer needs to directly download weather data from the Copernicus webpages.

**************************
Inversion of Arrival Times
**************************

Seismic and infrasonic data can be inverted to find a fragmentation or trajectory solution, either in an isotropic or a defined atmosphere or atmospheric realizations. The user may directly search for a fragmentation or a trajectory solution after indicating potential signals in station waveforms. 

*******************
Acoustic Ray Tracer
*******************

An direct-arrival acoustic wave may be traced through the atmosphere (or several atmospheres) given winds and temperatures in the given region. A 3-D model will be displayed showing the simulated path the acoustic wave moves through the atmosphere.

***************
Yield Estimater
***************

In testing... From a given overpressure recieved at a station from a blast a range, height, and pressure, the fragmentation yield can be estimated.
