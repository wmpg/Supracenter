Many pieces come together for this analysis, and the program downloads data from multiple sources. Information on those sources can be found here.

This Program

Stations
--------

A station is made up of a two character network identifier and a 3-5 character station identifier. For example, the station GR-I26H1 is in the GR network. A single network contains many stations, usually organized by the same group. In downloading the stations, BAM downloads data from the International Federation of Digital Seismograph Networks (FDSN). Citations should reflect the operators of the network which they are taken from, and are supplied by FDSN. For every network used in the program, find it here: https://www.fdsn.org/networks/ and find the citation on the corresponding page.
