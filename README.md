# Bolide Acoustic Modelling (BAM)
Computing fireball fragmentation locations and trajectory from seismic or infrasound data.

## Installation

1) This code depends on the WesternMeteorPyLib library. Make sure to install this library first: [https://github.com/dvida/WesternMeteorPyLib](https://github.com/wmpg/WesternMeteorPyLib)

2) In addition to WesternMeteorPyLib's requirements, you will need to install additional libraries. It is possible to install the libraries using pip, but you will have to manaully compile pyhdf, which is not fun. The easiest way to install everything is through conda:

```
conda install -c conda-forge pyhdf obspy simplekml pyopengl pyqtgraph folium
conda install -c anaconda netcdf4
pip install pyqt5==5.11.3
pip install pyswarm
```

(Optional) Termcolor is supported, but the program will still work without it:

```
pip install termcolor
```

3) Unzip the code into a folder on your computer

## Running a test case

The GUI for the program, which contains all of the features, can be run by:
```
python -m supra.bam
```
In the Anaconda prompt. Make sure you navigate to the folder above supra/ in your Anaconda prompt first.

For further documentation, look for About->Documentation in the GUI or if the GUI is not running,
